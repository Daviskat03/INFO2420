	<h2> Website 1 Critique - TraderJoes</h2>

		<li>My first impression of this website is that it looks like it has a nice clean layout. It doesn't look like they are trying to cram too much information on the site, and it doesn't feel overwhelming.</li>
		<li>The site orginizes its flow by using nice line breaks throughout the pages to differentiate the sections. There are links in each section from the homepage which makes it very user friendly. It uses a sub header for each section and a paragraph form for the text under it, which looks very nice and clean.</li>
		<li>The site structure makes sense to me. When you are on the homepage, you can easily click on a few links. The site has a navigation menu tucked up in the left corner in the title bar of the site, with clear simple sub titles to access other places on their site. There is a search icon in the title bar on the right side of the page, which I think is nice if you know what certain thing you are looking for, this makes it easy to navigate the website.</li>
		<li>The sites graphics are really great. There are multimedia images and it looks like hand drawn doodles that really enhance the layout of the site and I don't personally think it distracts at all from the site. I think it adds a good amount of little details to intrigue their customers.</li>
		<li>The home page of the website loaded really quickly. I think it was a reasonable load time.</li>
		<li>The text color was a nice contrast to the light backround colors of the site. The site mostly has a white background throughout all of the pages, with dark or black text, which works really nicley and the size was readable. All of the text sizes felt appropriate, not too big and not too small. I think the color and size of the text enhance the site.</li>
		<li>The site does have navigation, located in a navigation menu that is in the title bar of the site. I think the navigation was really well done with their orginization, simplicity, and colors. The site is really user friendly, and if you can't find what you are looking for you can simply search it from the magnifying glass in the top menu bar of the site. I think this helps enhance the navigation on this site. All of the links take you directly where they say they will take you, there are no weird pop ups or redirections, so that is a plus.</li>
		<li>The site does have a color scheme that is repeated throughout all the pages. There is a white/light background color with black/dark text. There are some images scattered throughout the pages and some hand drawn doodle type images scattered throughout as well. I think this adds to the site by making it feel fun and interesting to look at.</li>
		<li>The site responded to smaller window sizes really well. Nothing seemed to be affected by viewing the site in a smaller window.</li>
		<li>The site offers a customer voting area where customers can vote on which products from their store are their favorites. It looks like this has been going on for a while. The site says that it is the 17th annual "Customer Choice Awards." I didn't think this was unusual, but I did think it was a fun addition to the website. I think it helps the company know what products are doing well and which ones aren't, and I think it is a great way for them to make their customers feel heard and involved.</li>
